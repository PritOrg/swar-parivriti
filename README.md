# Flute Transposition & Learning Tool

Welcome to the **Flute Transposition & Learning Tool** by [Developer's Paradise](https://github.com/DevelopersParadise). This project is designed to assist flute players in transposing musical notes seamlessly and provides an interactive guide for learning flute fingering. It is especially suited for beginners looking to understand note transposition and flute finger placements visually.

## Project Overview

This tool offers:
- **Note Transposition Tool**: Allows users to transpose notes from one scale to another to match their flute’s root scale.
- **Interactive Fingering Chart**: A graphical representation of finger positions for each note on a 6-hole flute (bansuri), displayed dynamically in SVG format.
- **Gujarati Notation Support**: Supports both Western and Gujarati note notations, with a special mode called "Rajvi Special" that uses unique Gujarati symbols and format.

## Features

### Transposition Tool
The transposition tool enables you to transpose song notes to match your flute’s tuning:
- Input the original song scale and your flute’s root scale.
- Enter notes in either Western or Gujarati notation.
- Option to switch to "Rajvi Special" mode, using Gujarati symbols and unique formatting.
- The output displays both Western and Gujarati equivalents for the transposed notes.

### Flute Fingering Positions
An interactive SVG-based fingering chart visually demonstrates finger placements for various notes. Features include:
- **Real-time Fingering Visualization**: Select a note and register (middle, lowest, high, top), and view the corresponding finger positions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to different screen sizes, allowing easy use on mobile devices.
- **SVG Graphics**: Provides high-quality, scalable graphics with intuitive controls for each note.

### Rajvi Special Mode
For users familiar with Gujarati music notation, "Rajvi Special" mode:
- Inputs notes with unique Gujarati characters (e.g., `S` for "સા", `P` for "પ").
- Transposes notes with case-sensitivity and specific notational rules.
